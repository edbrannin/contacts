> 4. Add, remove, and edit contacts and contact information. (The “Notes” field has been especially helpful.)
> 5. Sort on different columns, especially last name and zip code. (I implemented this client side using a JavaScript library, which has worked just fine.)
> 6. Generate mailing labels for a given group in PDF.
